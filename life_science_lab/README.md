## 🌿 Introduction

The life sciences industry has long wrestled with the complexity of its own success: **rich datasets**, **complex regulations**, and **critical demands for speed and accuracy**. In 2025, a new paradigm is emerging to meet these challenges: **agentic AI**.

Agentic AI combines the raw power of large language models (LLMs) with the ability to **plan**, **orchestrate**, and **complete tasks** by interacting with other tools, data sources, and services.  
Rather than acting as a single intelligent assistant, **agentic AI works via a team of specialized agents**, collaborating behind the scenes to complete high-value work.

This bootcamp introduces participants to **agentic AI in life sciences** through a guided exploration and hands-on experience with **CLARA - Clinical and Laboratory AI for Regulatory Affairs**.

## Agentic AI in Life Sciences

### Current Adoption Landscape

The life sciences industry — with its structured workflows, rich data ecosystems, and pressing need for operational efficiency — is **among the first to realize real-world value** from agentic AI.

- **23% of pharma and healthcare** organizations have adopted AI agents as of 2024 (Cape Gemini).  
- **63% of surveyed executives** trust AI agents to analyze and synthesize data.  
- **50%** would trust an AI agent to send a professional email on their behalf.  
- More than **$2 billion** invested in agentic AI startups in the last two years (Deloitte).

### Why It Matters

As the industry faces mounting pressure to:
- accelerate drug development,  
- reduce costs,  
- personalize treatment, and  
- navigate complex regulatory environments,  

traditional workflows simply can’t keep up.

Agentic AI enables organizations to:
- **Automate multi-step processes**,  
- **Orchestrate data across silos**,  
- **Adapt dynamically** to evolving tasks, and  
- Unlock **new possibilities** for innovation and patient impact.

## Bootcamp Use Case Overview

During this bootcamp, participants will explore how **agentic AI** can revolutionize regulatory workflows through a **practical, enterprise-grade use case**:  
### **Automating Regulatory Document Generation with Agentic AI**

Regulatory submissions are a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical and biotech landscape — and a notorious bottleneck. Preparing **IND**, **NDA**, or **CSR** submissions requires pulling data from multiple systems, ensuring compliance with strict standards, and maintaining traceability.

#### How Agentic AI Streamlines This

1. **Data Retrieval Agent** – pulls clinical, non-clinical, and CMC data from backend systems.  
2. **Document Drafting Agent** – generates a draft submission report using regulatory templates.  
3. **Validation Agent** – checks formatting and compliance against regulatory guidelines.  
4. **Quality Review Agent** – ensures consistency, flags gaps, and supports human oversight.

**Result:** submission-ready regulatory documents in a fraction of the time, with fewer manual errors and faster timelines.
