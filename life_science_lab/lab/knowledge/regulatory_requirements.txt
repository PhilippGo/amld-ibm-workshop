## ICH E9 Statistical Principles

### Core Requirements:
1. **Trial Objectives**: Clearly stated primary and secondary objectives
2. **Design Considerations**: Randomization, blinding, control group
3. **Sample Size**: Justification with power calculation
4. **Analysis Populations**: ITT, Per Protocol, Safety
5. **Statistical Methods**: Pre-specified in protocol/SAP
6. **Missing Data**: Handling methods described (LOCF, MI, etc.)
7. **Multiplicity**: Adjustments for multiple comparisons
8. **Results Presentation**: Point estimates with CIs and p-values

### Confidence Interval Requirements:
- 95% CI standard (90% for equivalence/non-inferiority)
- Both bounds must be reported (not just "±")
- CI must not be swapped (lower < upper)
- Should reflect same effect measure as point estimate

### P-value Standards:
- Two-sided tests unless one-sided justified
- Exact p-values preferred (not just "<0.05")
- Multiple testing adjustments documented
- Significance level pre-specified

## GCP (Good Clinical Practice) Standards

### Data Integrity - ALCOA Principles:
- **Attributable**: Data traceable to source
- **Legible**: Readable and permanent
- **Contemporaneous**: Recorded when activity performed
- **Original**: First recording or certified copy
- **Accurate**: Error-free and valid

### Essential Documentation:
- Informed consent for all subjects
- Source data verification
- Protocol deviations documented
- Audit trail maintained

## CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, Controls) Requirements

### Quality Standards:
- All attributes within specification limits
- Certificate of Analysis (CoA) for each lot
- Stability data supporting shelf life
- Manufacturing process validated
- Quality control tests defined

### Specification Compliance:
- >95% in-specification rate expected
- Out-of-specification (OOS) investigations required
- Trending analysis for quality metrics
- Corrective/preventive actions (CAPA) for deviations

## Common Compliance Issues & Fixes

### Issue: CI Swapped
**Problem**: Confidence interval lower bound > upper bound  
**Example**: CI 1.5–1.2 (should be 1.2–1.5)  
**Fix**: Re-calculate with correct ordering  
**Impact**: BLOCKING - Cannot submit with inverted CIs  
**Time to fix**: 1 hour  

### Issue: Missing P-values
**Problem**: Efficacy endpoints without statistical significance  
**Example**: "HbA1c reduction: -1.2%" (no p-value)  
**Fix**: Calculate and add p-values for all efficacy endpoints  
**Impact**: BLOCKING for primary endpoint, WARNING for secondary  
**Time to fix**: 2-4 hours  

### Issue: Missing Units
**Problem**: Measurements without units of measure  
**Example**: "Weight change: -5.2" (should be "-5.2 kg")  
**Fix**: Add appropriate units to all endpoints  
**Impact**: WARNING if <90% coverage, BLOCKING if <50%  
**Time to fix**: 30 minutes - 2 hours  

### Issue: Low CI Coverage
**Problem**: <85% of endpoints have confidence intervals  
**Fix**: Calculate and add CIs to remaining endpoints  
**Impact**: WARNING, may delay review  
**Time to fix**: 4-8 hours  

### Issue: CMC Out of Specification
**Problem**: >5% of CMC attributes outside specification limits  
**Example**: Purity 98.2% (spec: 99.0-100.0%)  
**Fix**: Investigate root cause, retest, or accept with justification  
**Impact**: BLOCKING if >20% OOS, WARNING if 5-20%  
**Time to fix**: 1-4 weeks (includes investigation)  

### Issue: Study ID Not Present
**Problem**: Study identifier not referenced in document  
**Fix**: Add study ID to synopsis and throughout document  
**Impact**: BLOCKING - Cannot submit without proper identification  
**Time to fix**: 15 minutes

## Inspection Preparedness

### What Regulators Look For:
1. **Data Integrity**: Can you trace results to source?
2. **Protocol Compliance**: Were deviations documented?
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Pre-specified analysis followed?
4. **Safety Vigilance**: Were AEs properly reported?
5. **Quality Control**: Is manufacturing consistent?

### Red Flags for Regulators:
- Missing or incomplete data
- Unexplained protocol deviations
- Inconsistencies between documents
- Post-hoc analyses presented as pre-specified
- Insufficient documentation of decisions
- CMC trending towards OOS
- Pattern of unreported adverse events

## Timeline Estimates

### Remediation Timelines:

- **Moderate issues** (missing CIs, some p-values): 1-2 weeks
- **Major issues** (CI swaps, CMC OOS): 2-4 weeks
- **Critical issues** (data integrity, GCP violations): 1-3 months

### Submission Preparation:
- **Excellent quality study**: 2-4 weeks to submission
- **Good quality study**: 4-8 weeks to submission
- **Needs improvement**: 8-16 weeks to submission
- **Inadequate quality**: 16+ weeks to submission
